#### Install and configure git on your laptop/desktop**

**Step 1:** 

$ sudo apt-get update 
$ sudo apt­get install git ­-y

**Step 2:** 

$ git config -- global user.name "ericamellotte"
$ git config -- global user.email "ericamellotte@hotmail.co.uk"

**Step 3:**

To start versioning your code with Git, navigate to your newly created directory, ~/thesis. Run the command git init to initialize the current folder as a Git repository

$ cd ~/thesis

$ ls

analyze.R clean.py process.sh

$ git init

Initialized empty Git repository in ~/thesis/.git/

**Step 4:** 

To follow what Git is doing as you record the initial version of your files, use the informative command git status.

$ git status

On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:

    (use "git add <file>…" to include in what will be committed)

        analyze.R

        clean.py

        process.sh

**Step 5**

Notice: the three scripts are recognized as untracked files because you have not told Git to start tracking anything yet and the word “commit” is Git terminology for a snapshot. The output explains how you can track your files using git add. Start tracking the file process.sh.

$ git add process.sh

And check its new status.

$ git status

On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:

    (use "git rm --cached <file>…" to unstage)

        new file: process.sh

Untracked files:

    (use "git add <file>…" to include in what will be committed)

        analyze.R

        clean.py

**Step 6**

Use git add to begin tracking the other two files and add their changes to the staging area as well. Then create the first commit using the command git commit.

$ git add clean.py analyze.R

$ git commit -m "Add initial version of thesis code."

[master (root-commit) 660213b] Add initial version of thesis code.

3 files changed, 154 insertions(+)

create mode 100644 analyze.R

create mode 100644 clean.py

create mode 100644 process.sh

You have just performed the typical development cycle with Git: make some changes, add updated files to the staging area, and commit the changes as a snapshot once you are satisfied with them

**Step 7**

To view the record of your commits, use the command git log. For each commit, it lists the unique identifier for that revision, author, date, and commit message.

$ git log

commit 660213b91af167d992885e45ab19f585f02d4661

Author: First Last <ericamellotte>

Date: Tue Nov 26 11:52:05 2019–0500

    Add initial version of thesis code.

**Now you are free to make changes to the files knowing that you can always revert them to the state of this commit by referencing its identifier.**

Here is the current bottom of the file:

$ tail clean.py

# Filter based on fold-change over control sample

fc_cutoff = 10

epithelial = epithelial.filter(filter_fold_change, fc = fc_cutoff).saveas()

proximal_tube = proximal_tube.filter(filter_fold_change, fc = fc_cutoff).saveas()

kidney = kidney.filter(filter_fold_change, fc = fc_cutoff).saveas()

# Identify only those sites that are peaks in all three tissue types

combined = pybedtools.BedTool().multi_intersect(

    i = [epithelial.fn, proximal_tube.fn, kidney.fn])

union = combined.filter(lambda x: int(x[3]) = = 3).saveas()

union.cut(range(3)).saveas(data + "/sites-union.bed")

**Using a text editor, increase the fold change cutoff from 10 to 20.**

$ tail clean.py

# Filter based on fold-change over control sample

fc_cutoff = 20

epithelial = epithelial.filter(filter_fold_change, fc = fc_cutoff).saveas()

proximal_tube = proximal_tube.filter(filter_fold_change, fc = fc_cutoff).saveas()

kidney = kidney.filter(filter_fold_change, fc = fc_cutoff).saveas()

# Identify only those sites that are peaks in all three tissue types

combined = pybedtools.BedTool().multi_intersect(

    i = [epithelial.fn, proximal_tube.fn, kidney.fn])

union = combined.filter(lambda x: int(x[3]) = = 3).saveas()

union.cut(range(3)).saveas(data + "/sites-union.bed")

Because Git is tracking clean.py, it recognizes that the file has been changed since the last commit.

$ git status

# On branch master

# Changes not staged for commit:

#    (use "git add <file>…" to update what will be committed)

#    (use "git checkout --<file>…" to discard changes in working directory)

#

#    modified: clean.py

#

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

The report from git status indicates that the changes to clean.py are not staged, i.e., they are in the working directory (Fig 1). To view the unstaged changes, run the command git diff.

$ git diff

diff --git a/clean.py b/clean.py

index 7b8c058.76d84ce 100644

--- a/clean.py

+++ b/clean.py

proximal_tube = proximal_tube.filter(filter_fold_change, fc = fc_cutoff).saveas()

**undo the edit by following the directions from the output of git status to “discard changes in the working directory” using the command git checkout."**

$ git checkout -- clean.py

$ git diff

You could replace the argument -- with the commit identifier of the first commit you made above (your commit identifier will be different; use git log to find it). The -- used above was simply a placeholder for the first argument because, by default, git checkout restores the most recent version of the file from the staging area.

$ git checkout 660213b clean.py

**Step 8: Share your code**
Once you have your files saved in a Git repository, you can share it with your collaborators and the wider scientific community by putting your code online
